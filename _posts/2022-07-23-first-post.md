This is the first post of this blog.

<!--more-->
So I created blog using GitHub Pages. My plan is to use this blog as a place to write about topics that I studied/learned about, and other random stuff.
Most of the time I'll probably post stuff related to computer science and math, but I can't be sure.

Here are a few things I want to mention:
* I wasn't able to enable comments, but I am trying.
* English is not my native language, and there could be multiple grammatical errors. Please ignore for the tume being.

Currently I don't have anything interesting to post about, but at the same time want to write something, so I'll just show Hello World written in multiple differnt languages, in no particular order(I'll keep adding more if I fell like it).

### C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```
